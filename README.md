# NeutralNetwork_CPP

This repository contains an framework to build and train Neural Networks written in C++.
I have worked on this framwork in 2020 during the corona pandemic to introduce myself into the field of Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

Hence, it was only tested usibng a pretty small dataset, building and training works for an ANN.

In Addition, files for building an CNN were written. However, training functions are missing/not working.
